{"query": "What is the complete before-and-after comparison of using vs not using a setting/finishing procedure with full coverage foundation on oily skin?", "ground_truth": "Without a setting/finishing procedure on full coverage (90-100% opacity) foundation on oily skin: the sebum breaks down the foundation, causing it to transfer onto clothes, become patchy, and look uneven. The makeup slides off or pools in creases. With a proper setting procedure: the setting spray or powder creates a barrier that keeps the foundation locked in place. It absorbs excess sebum, extends wear time significantly, and maintains the matte finish throughout the day. The difference is between makeup that lasts 2-3 hours vs all-day extended wear.", "category": "ft_setting_consequences", "kg_keywords": "setting procedure|finishing procedure,locked in place,patchy,extend wear|extended wear"}
